This repository contains files needed for an ePortfolio-Presentation given in the lecture 'Software Engineering' in wintersemester 2018-2019 at the DHBW in Karlsruhe. 

# 1. Theoretical Part

You can find my slides [here](/Slides/slides.pdf).

# 2. Hands-on

Installation instructions for our hands-on part can be found [here](/Tutorial/Installation.md).

An general tutorial about the basic functionality of vim can be found [here](/Tutorial/Tutorial.md).

If you want to use my preconfigured vimrc, you can find it [here](/ExampleFiles/vimrc). You have to rename it to ".myvimrc" and place it in your home folder. This step is not needed for our hands-on part, because we will configure our own vimrc.
